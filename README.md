Greetings fellow coders! <BR>
I'm Paul, a professor at university. I teach programming to bright-eyed students, converting them from logic n00bs to elite hackerz. <Br>

My specialties? I sling C# for fun Windows apps that ain't just Solitaire clones.<Br> 
I weave Python scripts to automate my life, so I can spend more time on the boring paper writing.<Br>
I also teaching n00bs to code their first "Hello World" apps every year.<Br>
When not schooling students, you can catch me optimizing algorithms just for laughs.<Br>
I'm always looking to nerd snipe my way into coding challenges that let me flex my skills.<Br>

Ready to become an elite coder? Join me on this magical coding carpet ride! Programming never sounded so fun ;)<Br>
